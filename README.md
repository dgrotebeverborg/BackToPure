# BackToPure

## Overview
BackToPure is a Flask-based web application that simplifies the process of enriching and updating research-related records in Pure using external data sources such as Ricgraph and OpenAlex. This tool provides an interactive interface to handle the enrichment of internal and external person records, external organizations, research outputs, and datasets.

The application orchestrates a series of Python scripts to fetch, process, and upload data seamlessly via a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features
- **Home Dashboard:** Central hub for navigating different operations.
- **Enrich Internal Persons:** Enriches internal person profiles with identifiers such as ORCID.
- **Enrich External Persons:** Matches and updates external researchers with ORCID and OpenAlex IDs.
- **Enrich External Organizations:** Enriches external organizations in Pure with ROR IDs.
- **Import Research Outputs:** Imports research outputs from Ricgraph into Pure.
- **Import Datasets:** Imports datasets from Ricgraph into Pure.
- **Apply Updates:** Processes and uploads the updates to the Pure system.
- **Directory Access:** Opens directories with generated output files for review.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **OS:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher
- **Virtual Environment:** Recommended to use `venv`

### Dependencies
To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure the following dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:
- Flask
- pandas
- requests
- configparser
- logging
- tenacity (for retry logic)
- urllib3

### Access to Ricgraph
To use BackToPure, **access to Ricgraph** is mandatory. Ricgraph is a data storage and query system used to manage research-related data and link it to external systems. The application fetches data about faculties, researchers, and outputs directly from Ricgraph's API. Ensure that you have API access for querying Ricgraph.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/BackToPure.git
cd BackToPure
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Application
Edit `config.py` to set the following variables:
- `PURE_BASE_URL`: Base URL of the Pure API
- `PURE_API_KEY`: API key for Pure
- `RIC_BASE_URL`: Base URL of the Ricgraph API
- `FACULTY_PREFIX`: Prefix for faculties in Ricgraph

Ensure `src/config.ini` is updated with relevant API settings if needed.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Start the Flask Application
```bash
python BackToPure.py
```
The application will run on `http://localhost:5001`.

### 2. Navigate to the Dashboard
- Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5001`

### 3. Enrich and Update Records
- **Internal Persons:** Select the "Enrich Internal Persons" option and choose the desired faculty.
- **External Persons:** Choose "Enrich External Persons" to update records with OpenAlex and ORCID IDs.
- **External Organizations:** Enrich organizations with missing ROR IDs.
- **Import Research Outputs/Datasets:** Import data from Ricgraph into Pure.

### 4. Review and Apply Updates
- After each import or enrichment, access the relevant output files.
- Modify the CSV files to remove unwanted updates.
- Click "Apply Updates" to send changes to Pure.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: "Script path does not exist"**: Ensure all scripts are located in the `src/` directory.
- **Connection Issues:** Check if Ricgraph and Pure APIs are accessible.
- **Permission Denied:** Run the application with elevated permissions if required.
